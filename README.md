Introduction:
  - Sentiment analysis, a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP), involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.
  - With the exponential growth of user-generated content on the internet, sentiment analysis has become increasingly important in understanding public opinion.
  - IMDB, the popular movie and TV show database, hosts a vast collection of user reviews, making it an ideal dataset for sentiment analysis.
  - Analyzing IMDb movie reviews can provide valuable insights into audience perceptions, aiding filmmakers, studios, and enthusiasts alike.

Problem Statement:
  - Despite the abundance of movie reviews on IMDb, there is a need for automated sentiment analysis to efficiently categorize sentiments expressed in these reviews.
  - Manual analysis of large datasets is time-consuming and impractical, necessitating the development of accurate and scalable sentiment analysis models.
  - The challenge lies in creating a model that can accurately classify diverse sentiments, ranging from positive and negative to nuanced opinions, within the context of movie reviews.
  - Addressing this problem will not only enhance our understanding of audience sentiments towards specific movies but also contribute to the broader field of sentiment analysis in the context of entertainment media.
